# Source Code Root (src/)

This is the main source code directory for your application, organized into logical
modules to promote maintainability, scalability, and reusability.

* services/: Business logic, data fetching, and interactions with external APIs
  or data sources. Examples: UserService.js, ProductService.js,
  AnalyticsService.js.
* classes/: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) classes that represent data models,
  complex algorithms, or encapsulate specific functionalities. Examples: User.js,
  ShoppingCart.js.
* utils/: Small, pure helper functions for common, reusable tasks. Generally
  stateless and side-effect free. Examples: formatDate.js, validateEmail.js,
  debounce.js.
* tokens/: Foundational design properties like colors, spacing, typography,
  breakpoints, and z-indices. Ensure consistency and facilitate theme changes.
  Examples: colors.js, spacing.js.
* constants/: Immutable values used throughout the application, including magic
  strings, numbers, API endpoint paths, and enumeration-like objects. Examples:
  apiEndpoints.js, userRoles.js.
* templates/: High-level structural components or layouts defining overall page
  structure (headers, footers, sidebars). Examples: DefaultLayout.js,
  DashboardLayout.js.
* views/: Top-level components representing full pages or major sections.
  Orchestrate smaller components and connect to services. Examples: HomePage.js,
  ProductDetailPage.js.
* components/: Reusable UI components more complex than basic elements, often
  combining multiple elements with internal state or logic. Examples:
  UserProfileCard.js, Modal.js.
* elements/: Smallest, atomic, highly reusable UI building blocks. Typically
  stateless, focusing on rendering basic HTML elements with specific styling.
  Examples: Button.js, Input.js.
* configs/: Application-wide configuration settings that might vary between
  environments (development, staging, production). Examples: env.js,
  firebaseConfig.js.
* hooks/: Custom React hooks (or similar reusable logic units) encapsulating
  stateful logic and side effects. Promote code reuse and cleaner component
  logic. Examples: useAuth.js, useForm.js.
* mixins/: Reusable CSS mixins (Sass/Less) or utility classes
  (plain CSS/CSS-in-JS) for consistent styling. Examples: flexbox.scss,
  shadows.js.
* assets/: Static files directly served or bundled with the application.
  * icons/: SVG icons, icon fonts, or icon components.
  * i18n/: Internationalization (i18n) translation data (e.g., en.json,
    es.json).
  * maps/: Data maps, lookup tables, or JSON data.
  * images/: General images (logos, illustrations).
  * fonts/: Custom font files.
* lib/: Custom wrappers, configurations, or specific integrations with
  third-party libraries. Isolates external dependencies. Examples: analytics.js,
  charting.js.
* styles/: Global CSS files, theme definitions, and base styles. Examples:
  global.css, theme.js.
* types/: TypeScript type and interface definitions shared across the
  application. Examples: user.d.ts, product.d.ts.
* App.jsx: Main application component.

## Future-Proofing Your Architecture for 2026 and Beyond

The 5-Layer Architecture is not just about solving today’s problems; it’s about building systems that are adaptable to future changes and emerging technologies.

### Emerging Trends Integration

The architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate with emerging trends like AI/ML, edge computing, and serverless.

The architecture supports:

*   **AI/ML Integration:** By incorporating an EventStream to capture user actions for ML training, a FeatureStore for real-time feature computation, and a ModelRegistry for serving predictions.
*   **Edge Computing Preparation:** By allowing processing at edge nodes with a fallback to central processing and a SyncManager for data synchronization, optimizing latency and resource usage.

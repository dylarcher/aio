## Bringing It All Together: Implementation Strategy

Transitioning to a 5-Layer Architecture requires a well-planned implementation strategy, especially when migrating from existing monolithic applications.

### Migration Path from Monolith to 5-Layer Architecture

A gradual migration strategy is recommended to minimize risk and disruption. This typically involves several phases, incrementally adding layers and refactoring existing functionality.

The ArchitectureMigrator class details a gradual migration strategy from a monolith to a 5-layer architecture. It outlines key phases:

*   **Phase 1: Add Monitoring Layer:** Implement comprehensive monitoring first to gain visibility.
*   **Phase 2: Extract API Gateway:** Introduce an API Gateway and gradually route traffic through it, using traffic splitting.
*   **Phase 3: Implement Circuit Breakers:** Add fault tolerance mechanisms.
*   **Phase 4: Split Data Layer (CQRS):** Separate read and write concerns, often involving dual writes during the transition.
*   **Phase 5: Service Extraction:** Incrementally extract bounded contexts into new microservices, typically using the Strangler Fig pattern.

Crucially, each phase has an associated rollback strategy (simple-disable, traffic-switch, dual-write-rollback, strangler-fig-rollback) to quickly revert changes in case of issues, minimizing downtime and risk

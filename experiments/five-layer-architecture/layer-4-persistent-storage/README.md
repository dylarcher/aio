## Layer 4: Persistent Storage Strategies

The storage layer is often a bottleneck and a source of fragility in applications. This layer focuses on strategies for robust and scalable data persistence.

### Multi-Database Strategy with CQRS

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that separates the read and write operations into different models, often backed by different databases. This separation allows for independent scaling, optimization, and evolution of read and write concerns, improving performance, scalability, and maintainability.

This CQRSDataStore class demonstrates how to separate commands (writes) and queries (reads). Key features include:

*   **Separate Databases:** Utilizes writeDB for transactional writes and readDBs for scalable reads.
*   **Command Processing:** Validates commands, executes business logic within a transaction, and stores events (for event sourcing).
*   **Asynchronous Read Model Updates:** After a command commits, events are processed asynchronously by projectionHandlers to update read-optimized materialized views, ensuring eventual consistency.
*   **Query Processing:** Reads data from load-balanced read replicas, optionally serving from a cache first and caching results for performance.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Strategies to invalidate relevant cache entries after a command modifies data.
*   **Command/Validator/Projection Handlers:** A clear structure for defining and registering specific logic for different command types and their effects on read models.

### Backup and Recovery Automation

Robust data persistence also requires a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy. This ensures data integrity and availability in case of data loss or corruption, supporting automated scheduling and various recovery methods.

This BackupManager class outlines a comprehensive automated backup and recovery system. It covers:

*   **Scheduled Backups:** Supports scheduling incremental, daily, weekly, and monthly backups.
*   **Database-Specific Backups:** Abstracted methods for creating backups for different database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB), typically by executing external dump commands.
*   **Encryption:** Ensures data security by encrypting backups using AES-256-GCM.
*   **Cloud Storage Integration:** Uploads encrypted backups to a specified storage provider (e.g., AWS S3) and records metadata.
*   **Retention Policy:** Automatically cleans up old backups based on a defined retention policy (e.g., keeping 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly backups).
*   **Recovery Methods:** Includes functionalities to recover from a specific backup, decrypt data, restore the database, and optionally apply incremental backups for point-in-time recovery.
*   **Integrity Testing:** Provides a mechanism to regularly test the integrity of backups, ensuring they are restorable

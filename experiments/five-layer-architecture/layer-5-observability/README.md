## Layer 5: Observability and Monitoring

The final layer ensures that you can understand the behavior of your distributed system, detect issues early, and respond effectively

### Comprehensive Monitoring Implementation

Comprehensive monitoring involves collecting various types of metrics (counters, gauges, histograms), creating alerts based on thresholds, sending notifications, and visualizing data through dashboards. This provides deep insights into application performance and health.

This MonitoringSystem class offers a comprehensive suite of observability features:

*   **Metric Collection:** Supports counters, gauges, and histograms, allowing detailed tracking of various system aspects (e.g., response times, error rates, resource usage).
*   **Alerting System:** Allows defining alerts based on metric conditions, with thresholds, comparison types, windows, and cooldowns. When triggered, alerts send notifications via configured channels (Slack, email, webhooks).
*   **Dashboards:** Enables the creation of dashboards with various widgets (metric values, charts, tables) to visualize collected data and provide real-time insights.
*   **Metrics Flushing:** Buffers metrics and flushes them periodically to a long-term storage backend (like InfluxDB or Prometheus).
*   **Health Check Endpoint:** Provides a /health endpoint that reports system status, uptime, memory usage, and active alerts, useful for external load balancers or orchestrators.
*   **Express.js Middleware:** Demonstrates how to integrate monitoring into an Express.js application to automatically track API response times, request counts, and error rates.

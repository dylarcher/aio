## Layer 2: API Gateway and Request Orchestration

The API Gateway acts as the single point of entry for all incoming requests, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. This layer provides a unified interface, decoupling clients from the complexities of backend services.

### Creating a Unified Interface for Distributed Services

This API Gateway implementation includes:

*   **Security Headers (Helmet):** Protecting the application from common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage with different limits for different endpoints.
*   **Request Logging and Monitoring:** Tracking request metadata, duration, status, and reporting metrics.
*   **Health Checks:** Probing the health of underlying services (database, Redis, external services) and reporting a degraded status if necessary.
*   **Dynamic Routing (Proxy Middleware):** Forwarding requests to the appropriate backend microservices.
*   **Correlation IDs:** Adding a unique identifier to requests to trace them across multiple services for easier debugging.
*   **Centralized Error Handling:** Catching proxy errors and general application errors, providing consistent responses.

### Advanced Versioning Strategy

A robust API Gateway also needs an advanced versioning strategy to handle different API versions gracefully. This allows you to evolve your services without breaking existing clients.
